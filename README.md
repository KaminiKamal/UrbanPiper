# Project Title

Twitter Application

## Getting Started

The application will authenticate the twitter user using firebase OAuth and display the 5 feeds at a time. The user can upvote or downvote the tweets and view them on separate page. 



### Installing

1. clone the repo and run 'npm install'

### Bugs
1. The packages used maynot be compatible with your OS so please see snapshots attached for references (since I have used the latest fedora version).

###Libraries and packages used
1. twit has been used instead of directly calling twitter APIs.
2. semantic-ui-react has been used instead of HTML/CSS.
